After installing the app, download the .js file linked in this repository. You can download it by clicking the "Go To File" button below, then clicking the "Download raw file" button.  
Once downloaded, move the .js file into the Scriptable folder in your iCloud Drive. You can access your iCloud Drive through the Files app on your iPhone.

Or, if you'd rather, you can copy the code from the .js file and paste it into a new script in the Scriptable editor.

## Usage

Using the script is simple! After it is installed, just add it as a widget to your home screen! You can also tap on the widget to interact with it.
